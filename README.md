Some code to experiment with Compose canvas.

Wanted to develop own code to calculate scalable bar and line graphs for my own apps rather than
using libraries. Also wanted to experiment with shapes and colour.

Having a look online for ideas came across the AutoSleep app (https://autosleepapp.tantsissa.com/)
which is an aesthetically beautiful app and it is the inspiration for this code project.

This is an educational project only and does not comply with clean code as the main purpose was
to develop the bar and line graph algorithm and play with compose canvas.

Enjoy!
